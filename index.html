<h3>Pollution</h2>
<p> Pollution is the introduction of harmful materials into the environment. These harmful materials are called pollutants.<br/>
	Landfills collect garbage and other land pollution in a central location. Many places are running out of space for landfills.
	Pollutants can be natural, such as volcanic ash. They can also be created by human activity, such as trash or runoff produced by factories. Pollutants damage the quality of air, water, and land. In this Website , We Mainly focus on Land Pollution </p>
<h3>Four Types of Pollution</h3>

<h1>Land Pollution</h1>
<p>	Many of the same pollutants that foul the water also harm the land. Mining sometimes leaves the soil contaminated with dangerous chemicals.<br>

	Pesticides and fertilizers from agricultural fields are blown by the wind. They can harm plants, animals, and sometimes people. Some fruits and vegetables absorb the pesticides that help them grow. When people consume the fruits and vegetables, the pesticides enter their bodies. Some pesticides can cause cancer and other diseases.<br>
	Trash is another form of land pollution. Around the world, paper, cans, glass jars, plastic products, and junked cars and appliances mar the landscape. Litter makes it difficult for plants and other producers in the food web to create nutrients. Animals can die if they mistakenly eat plastic.<br>

	Garbage often contains dangerous pollutants such as oils, chemicals, and ink. These pollutants can leech into the soil and harm plants, animals, and people.

	Inefficient garbage collection systems contribute to land pollution. Often, the garbage is picked up and brought to a dump, or landfill. Garbage is buried in landfills. Sometimes, communities produce so much garbage that their landfills are filling up. They are running out of places to dump their trash</p></br>

        <img src="C:\Users\devas\Downloads\websitee\pic\pic1.jpg" alt="Land Pollution" width="1000" height="500"></br>

<p>	Sometimes, landfills are not completely sealed off from the land around them. Pollutants from the landfill leak into the earth in which they are buried. Plants that grow in the earth may be contaminated, and the herbivores that eat the plants also become contaminated. So do the predators that consume the herbivores. This process, where a chemical builds up in each level of the food web, is called bioaccumulation.</br>

	Pollutants leaked from landfills also leak into local groundwater supplies. There, the aquatic food web (from microscopic algae to fish to predators such as sharks or eagles) can suffer from bioaccumulation of toxic chemicals.</br>

	Some communities do not have adequate garbage collection systems, and trash lines the side of roads. In other places, garbage washes up on beaches. Kamilo Beach, in the U.S. state of Hawai'i, is littered with plastic bags and bottles carried in by the tide. The trash is dangerous to ocean life and reduces economic activity in the area. Tourism is Hawai'i’s largest industry. Polluted beaches discourage tourists from investing in the area’s hotels, restaurants, and recreational activities.</br>

	Some cities incinerate, or burn, their garbage. Incinerating trash gets rid of it, but it can release dangerous heavy metals and chemicals into the air. So while trash incinerators can help with the problem of land pollution, they sometimes add to the problem of air pollution.</p>

        <h2>Causes of Land Pollution</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Plastics Usage</b> -Plastic also pollutes without being littered—specifically, through the release of compounds used in its manufacture. Indeed, pollution of the environment by chemicals leached from plastics into air and water is an emerging area of concern. </li></br>
        
             <img src="C:\Users\devas\Downloads\websitee\pic\pic2.jpg" alt="Plastic usage" width="1000" height="500"></br>
        
            <li><b>Agricultural Activities</b> – As animal production grows, it becomes decoupled from crop production, causing normal nutrient cycles between plants, soil, and animals to be severely disrupted, resulting in the widespread use of synthetic herbicides, insecticides, bactericides, and fertilizers, all of which contribute to pollution.</li></br><img src="C:\Users\devas\Downloads\websitee\pic\pic8.jpeg" alt="Agricultural Activities" width="1000" height="500"></br>
            <li><b>Mining Activities</b> – Mining has the potential to pollute the air and water supply, damage biodiversity and ecosystems, and permanently alter natural landscapes. Mining harms the ecosystem by destroying habitats, causing soil erosion, and polluting surface water, groundwater, and soil.</li></br>
            <img src="C:\Users\devas\Downloads\websitee\pic\pic9.jpeg" alt="Mining Activities" width="1000" height="500"></br>
            <li><b>Urbanization</b> – Intensive urbanization will exacerbate poverty by preventing local municipalities from providing services to all residents. Increased air pollution from concentrated energy usage has a direct effect on human health. Lead levels in urban air are elevated as a result of automobile emissions.</li>  </br>          
            <img src="C:\Users\devas\Downloads\websitee\pic\pic10.jpeg" alt="Urbanization" width="1000" height="500"></br>
            <li><b>Nuclear Waste</b> – The soil is also contaminated by radioactive waste from nuclear research stations and nuclear power plants, as well as radioactive fallout from nuclear explosions. Since radioactive materials have a long half-life, they can survive in the soil for long periods of time.</li></br>

        <h2>Effects of Land Pollution</h2>
        <p>The pollution of land has calamitous consequences especially concerning the survival of animals and humans and the quality of soil and water. Environmental protection agencies indicate that the effects can even be more devastating if wastes in landfills are not separated into reusable, recyclable, or organic waste. Since the advent of industrialization, human activities have gradually destroyed and degraded land, causing diseases to humans and animals and reducing the capacity to support ecosystem and various life forms. Land pollution has many long lasting effects.</p><br>
        <ol>
        <li><b>Effect on Human Health</b>- <p>Many regions across the world harbor loads of waste and have incredibly pitiable waste collection services especially in developing countries and slum areas. Others have appropriate waste collection systems, but they eventually end up in the landfills without proper regulation.</p></li><br>
        <li><b>Increase in Landfill Sites</b>-<p>When land is contaminated with solid agricultural and industrial waste, it leads to increase in landfill sites across the city. Landfills also become breeding grounds for mice, rodents, flies, and birds that can transmit diseases. These landfills are contaminated with such kind of toxic chemicals that they can reach the human body via vegetables and foods that are grown in polluted lands. They can also seep into water bodies used for consumer purposes or could be inhaled by humans from polluted dust. Apart form that, these huge pile of wastes across the city results in tourist distraction and can be loss of revenue for tourism industry.</p></li><br>
            <li><b>Soil Pollution</b>-<p> Soil pollution is categorized under land pollution. Hence, when there is overuse of fertilizer chemicals or lands are degraded through chemical and solid waste dumping, the upper layer of the soil is damaged, causing soil pollution. The effects of agricultural, healthcare, and chemical wastes are the principal land pollution aspects causing soil pollution.</p></li><br>
            <li><b>Environmental Degradation</b>-<p>Deforestation is the top concern for matters pertaining environmental degradation. It causes the destruction of the ecosystems and the habitat. Deforestation compromises the cutting down of vegetation and tree cover which creates harsh environmental conditions such as intense heat from the sun and also disrupts the rain cycle.</p></li><br>

            <p>It is essential to practice reforestation and afforestation. Organic fertilizers, an integrated pest control method, and crop rotation can all be used by farmers. One of the most important ways to help minimize landfill waste, protect natural resources, preserve wildlife, reduce noise, reduce energy use, and slow global warming is to incorporate recycling habits into your everyday life.</p>
            <h4>Plastic codes</h4>
            <p>The plastic codes are actually numbers that indicate the type of plastic and whether or not it is recyclable. Understanding plastic codes and what they mean is essential for properly disposing of plastic items and helping to reduce the amount of plastic waste in our environment.</p></br>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions – FAQs</h2>
        <ol>
        <li><b>What is the prevention of land pollution?</b>
            <p>One can reuse products like fabric, plastic bags, and glass in your home rather than throwing them away to minimize solid waste emissions on soil. Recycling helps to minimize the amount of solid waste that ends up in landfills while also helping to save natural resources.</p></li>
        <li><b>What are sources of land pollution?</b>
            <p>Land contamination is caused by human activities such as littering and waste washed ashore from vessels, oil platforms, and sewage treatment plants. Land contamination occurs when trash, waste, and other pollutants are dumped on the land, contaminating or polluting it.</p></li><li><b>What are the effects of land pollution on animals?</b><p>Chemicals such as arsenic, mercury, chromium, lead, and ammonia, among others, can contaminate water and land-based flora. Animals and humans are poisoned by it. One of the major causes of lungs and respiratory disorders is air pollution caused by land pollution.</p></li>
        <li><b>What are the effects of pollution?</b><p>Pollution can cause mudslides, poison soils and rivers, and even destroy plants and animals. Pollution causes damage to humans on a daily basis. Long-term air pollution exposure, for example, can cause chronic respiratory disease, lung cancer, and other illnesses.
</p></li><li><b>What is land pollution and its causes?</b><p>Soil pollution is a form of land pollution in which the soil’s upper layer is harmed. Overuse of chemical fertilizers, soil degradation caused by running water, and other pest control measures contribute to the loss of agricultural land, forest cover, and grazing pastures, among other things.</p></li>
            <li><b>Which plastic number is safe?</b><p> Plastic recycling numbers 2, 4 and 5 are the safest. Whereas plastic numbers 1, 3, 6 and 7 must be avoided. But it does not indicate that you can fearlessly use safer plastic. All plastic products can leach toxic chemicals when heated or damaged.</p></li>
